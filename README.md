# Census Apportionment Project
The country’s population is always shifting and the impact of the changes in population can affect funding for schools, health programs, housing projects and more.  Each year changes in population are monitored to observe changes that might impact funding issues controlled by the apportionment of a state within the country.  Can the US Census Apportionment dataset be used to determine when a state’s apportionment is likely to change?  This information would be highly useful for a state to help budget for growth in a more efficient manner.  Any advantage that a state could have to predict its citizen’s needs would be helpful when evaluating the data for state population, providing for planning that includes knowing when a state will have a change in the House of Representatives apportionment can be leveraged.
